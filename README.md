Algorithms implemented in Python.

## Linked Lists

* A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
* Time Complexity

|                 | Singly linked list | Doubly linked list | Array |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----- |
| Search          | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(1)  |
| Add(at head)    | O(1)               | O(1)               | O(n)  |
| Remove(at head) | O(1)               | O(1)               | O(n)  |

## Stack

* A stack is a one-ended linear data structure which have two primary operations, namely push and pop.
* Unlike an array, a stack does not offer constant-time access to the i-th item. It does allow constant time adds and removes, as it doesn't require shifting elements around.
* Time complexity

| operations | time complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| pushing    | O(1)            |
| popping    | O(1)            |
| peeking    | O(1)            |
| searching  | O(n)            |
